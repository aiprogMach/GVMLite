# GVMLite
Guava Virtual Machine (prototype)
This project is for fun, and it will be entry point to the real GVM!

Built entirely in C.

Coming soon!

[Update] as of 24/1/2018
The project faced many problems because of bad design decisions, I will not publish the code since it is not good enough, but I 'll make a redesign for the project and republish it when it is good enough for a prototype. This a good advantage for prototype projects.
